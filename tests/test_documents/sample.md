# Machine Learning Fundamentals

## Supervised Learning

Supervised learning uses labeled training data to learn a mapping from inputs to outputs.

## Unsupervised Learning

Unsupervised learning finds patterns in unlabeled data.

## Reinforcement Learning

Reinforcement learning trains agents through reward signals.
