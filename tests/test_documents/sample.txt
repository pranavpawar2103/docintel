Introduction to RAG Systems

Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) is a technique that combines information retrieval with text generation. The key insight is that large language models can produce more accurate and factual responses when they have access to relevant context from a knowledge base.

How RAG Works

1. Query Processing: The user's question is converted into an embedding vector.
2. Retrieval: Similar documents are found using vector similarity search.
3. Generation: The LLM generates a response based on the retrieved context.

Benefits of RAG

- Factual Grounding: Responses are based on retrieved documents, reducing hallucinations.
- Up-to-date Information: The knowledge base can be updated without retraining the model.
- Attribution: Sources can be cited, improving transparency.
